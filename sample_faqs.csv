Question,Answer
Who is the target audience for the QnA Maker tool?,"<p>QnA Maker is primarily meant to provide a FAQ data source that you can query from your bot/application. Although developers will find this useful, content owners will especially benefit from this tool. QnA Maker is a completely no-code way of managing the content that powers your bot/application.</p>"
How do I log in to the QnA Maker Portal?,"<p>You can log in with your <a href=""https://account.microsoft.com/account"">Microsoft account</a>.</p>"
Is the QnA Maker Service free?,"<p>Yes. The QnA Maker tool is currently free to use. However, we do meter usage per account. See the Subscription Keys section of the documentation for details.</p>"
"My URLs have valid FAQ content, but the tool cannot extract them. Why not?","<p>It’s possible that the tool is not able to auto-extract QnA from valid FAQ URLs. In such cases, you have the option of copying and pasting the QnA content into a .txt and then trying to ingest it. Alternately, you can always editorially add content to your knowledge base.</p>"
What format does the tool expect the file content to be?,"<p><p>We support two formats of files for ingestion.</p><ol><li>.tsv: QnA contained in the Question-Answer format</li><li>.txt, .docx, .pdf: QnA contained as regular FAQ content, i.e. a sequence of questions and answers.</li></ol></p>"
How large a knowledge base can I create?,"<p>Currently, we have a limit of a 20 MB knowledge base.</p>"
Do I need to use Bot Framework in order to use QnA Maker?,"<p>No, you don’t. However, QnA Maker is offered as one of several templates in <a href=""/en-gb/services/bot-service/"">Azure Bot Service</a> that enables rapid intelligent bot development powered by Microsoft Bot Framework, and runs in a serverless environment. Bots scale based on demand; only pay for the resources you consume.</p>"
Where is the test web-chat URL from the old portal? How do I share my KB with others now?,"<p>In the new service, we do not have the test URL anymore. This is because, as part of the cognitive services, all calls are being metered. As the test URL exposes the subscription key and the KB ID, it is a security risk. However, it is still super easy to chat with your KB and share it. Take a look at the Azure Bot Templates for <a href=""https://blog.botframework.com/2016/12/13/More-Ways-to-Make-Smart-Bots/"">Question and Answer Bot</a>. You can light up the QnA Bot in Skype in a few clicks, and then share it with anyone.</p>"
